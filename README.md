# Face-Recognition
Face recognition is ubiquitous in science fiction: the protagonist looks at a camera, and the camera scans his or her face to recognize the person.
More formally, we can formulate face recognition as a classification task, where the inputs are images and the outputs are peopleâ€™s names.
We use a popular technique for face recognition called eigen faces. And at the heart of eigenfaces is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique called principal component analysis (PCA),
and we will see how we can apply this general technique to our specific task of face recognition.
